# Weekly dev report for 2017-05-01 to 2017-05-07 (week 18)

This report covers weekly developments in the [moby/vpnkit], [mirage/ocaml-dns], [mirage/ocaml-hvsock],
[djs55/ocaml-osx-dnssd] and [mirage/mirage-tcpip] repositories.

**TL;DR:** A quiet week for VPNKit as work has focussed on support improvements via logging and an update to the documentation
and architecture in the [README](README.md).

## PRs merged

- A minor improvement to the OCaml bindings to `SOMAXCONN` ([moby/vpnkit#217] [@yallop] [@djs55]).
- Update the documentation to reflect the latest architecture ([moby/vpnkit#218] [@djs55])
