  # We are only using ocamlfind during configuration of the Unix binding.
  # However, ocamlfind also installs the "threads" package, and ocamlfind
  # 1.7.3-1 is the first one whose threads package does not have incorrect error
  # lines. See

  # If ocamlfind becomes no longer necessary for configuration of Lwt, this
  # dependency should be converted to a conflict, and package jbuilder should be
  # constrained such that it also includes the error lines fix.
